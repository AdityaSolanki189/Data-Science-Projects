# Problem: [SNAPCHAT] Palindrome Checker

# Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

# For example, carerac should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. sunset should return false, since thereâ€™s no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.

# A string can be a palindrome only if it has even pair of characters and at max 1 odd character

            if i in temp.keys():
                temp[i] = temp[i] + 1
            else:
                temp[i] = 1
