    "> Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)\n",
    "> Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) usually mean fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The \"fully-connectedness\" of these networks makes them prone to overfitting the data.\n",
    "> These MLP models are also referred to as either deep feed forward networks or feed forward neural networks. MLPs are common in simple logistic and linear regression problems."
